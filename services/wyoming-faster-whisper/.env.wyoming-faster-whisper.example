# wyoming-faster-whisper Environment Example
# See https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-faster-whisper for full details
# Built from source to include latest VAD support

# --- Model Configuration ---
# Model to use (tiny, tiny-int8, base, base-int8, small, small-int8, medium, large, or HuggingFace model path)
# int8 models are quantized for faster inference with minimal quality loss
# Speed ranking: tiny-int8 > base-int8 > small-int8 > small > medium > large
# Quality ranking: large > medium > small > base > tiny
# Recommended: base-int8 (good balance of speed and accuracy)
FASTER_WHISPER_MODEL=base-int8

# Language for transcription (auto, en, de, fr, es, etc. - see Whisper language codes)
# Setting a specific language (e.g., 'en') is faster than 'auto' detection
FASTER_WHISPER_LANGUAGE=en

# Beam size for decoding (0 for auto, higher = more accurate but slower)
# 1 = greedy decoding (fastest), 5 = default beam search
# For real-time use, 1 is recommended
FASTER_WHISPER_BEAM_SIZE=1

# Number of CPU threads for inference (higher = faster on multi-core systems)
# Set to number of CPU cores available, or slightly less to leave headroom
FASTER_WHISPER_CPU_THREADS=8

# Compute type for inference (default, int8, float16, float32)
# int8 is fastest on CPU
FASTER_WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8

# --- VAD (Voice Activity Detection) Configuration ---
# VAD filters out non-speech audio to reduce hallucinations and improve response times

# Speech probability threshold (0.0-1.0, lower = more sensitive)
FASTER_WHISPER_VAD_THRESHOLD=0.5

# Minimum speech duration in milliseconds before processing
FASTER_WHISPER_VAD_MIN_SPEECH_MS=200

# Minimum silence duration in milliseconds to split audio segments
# Lower values = faster response times but may split mid-sentence
# 400ms is aggressive but good for short commands
FASTER_WHISPER_VAD_MIN_SILENCE_MS=400
